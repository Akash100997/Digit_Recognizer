## Digit Recognizer / Classifier

This project is a simple deep neural network that classifies digits from 0 to 9. I had used the tensorflow framework to build, compile and to train the model. 

You can go through [MNIST Database Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) if you are willing to and here is an example of ![MNIST Datas](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40afozbek_%2Fhow-to-train-a-model-with-mnist-dataset-d79f8123ba84&psig=AOvVaw35EFM9nks_AuceBgzorvY3&ust=1623251678767000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCKDsxfSpiPECFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)

Steps to be followed are:
1. Download the MNIST Datas
2. Separate the Train and Test Datas
3. Build the Model with Simple Sequential Feed Forward Network.
4. Compile the model with proper loss and optimizer function.
5. Train the model.
6. Make some predictions (Tweak some hyperparameters(learning rate, epochs) if required).

And that's it you have done building your Simple MNIST Classifier.
